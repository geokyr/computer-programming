Lab Assignments for the [Computer Programming](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3020) course, during the 1st semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Lab Assignments

There were a total of 8 lab assignments in this course, each one consisting of a set of exercises that had to be submitted to the course's [grader](http://grader.softlab.ntua.gr/). The grader was a web application that automatically tested the submitted code against a set of test cases and provided feedback on the correctness of the solution, with time and memory constraints.

The aim was to get familiar with computer programming and algorithmic problem solving. The assignments were written in C/C++, some of them with the help of [pzhelp](https://github.com/softlab-ntua/pzhelp), a provided header file defining a set of C macros that are meant to facilitate learning C/C++. The key goals of each lab assignment are described below.

## Lab 01

- Practise with the vi editor
- Practise with the gcc compiler

## Lab 02

- Output to screen
- Input from keyboard
- Simple calculator of addition of two fractions

## Lab 03

- Control flow
- Functions
- Output formatting
- Advanced calculator of fractions

## Lab 04

- Arrays
- String manipulation

## Lab 05

- Arrays of higher dimensions
- Checks for invalid input
- Error handling
- Character encoding and decoding

## Lab 06

- Most of the problem statements are missing

## Lab 08

- Classes
- Dynamic data structures
